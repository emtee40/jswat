## Java Debugger ##

JSwat is a graphical Java debugger front-end, written to use the Java
Platform Debugger Architecture and based on the NetBeans Platform. Its
features include sophisticated breakpoints; colorized source code display
with code navigator; movable display panels showing threads, call stack,
visible variables, and loaded classes; command interface for more advanced
features; and Java-like expression evaluation, including method invocation.

## Discontinued ##

This project is effectively discontinued as of 2013. It is known _not_ to work with Java 8 and possibly even Java 7. No one is working on this project any more. Please have a look at one of the much better alternatives.
